This is a tool which parses one or multiple logs and analyzes them. Then it creates a report which can be exported as: `Excel File`, `RTF/Word File`, `Markdown`, `.txt` and `json`.
It can help you in multiple ways: 1: Find out why your Server is always crashing or just to get stats of your server.  

This tool is in Beta / In development and i can't guarantee a 100% correct result. This tool can be wrong (but i hope it won't).

If you miss any feature or want to report a bug then please see the issues tab. This tool currently only works for non-modded servers (for example: Paper, Spigot, Vanilla). Also this tool is written 100% in Python.
